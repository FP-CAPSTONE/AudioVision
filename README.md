# 🎓 AudioVision – A Voice-Based Navigation App for the Visually Impaired 🗺️🎙️

AudioVision is our **Final Year Capstone Project** developed at **President University**, aimed at enhancing **mobility, safety, and independence** for visually impaired individuals through smart voice-based navigation and real-time object detection.

Built using **Flutter**, the application integrates **Google Maps**, **YOLO object detection**, and **speech technologies** to deliver an intuitive and accessible navigation experience.

## 🔍 What is AudioVision?

AudioVision is an assistive navigation system that converts map and environmental data into **real-time voice guidance**, enabling visually impaired users to move freely and safely without relying on visual cues.

Whether navigating city streets, identifying nearby landmarks, or avoiding obstacles, AudioVision provides a seamless, speech-based experience.

## 🔥 Key Features

- ✅ **Voice-Guided Navigation**  
  Real-time audio directions to guide users safely through their environment.

- ✅ **Object & Obstacle Detection**  
  Uses computer vision (YOLO) to detect obstacles like poles, people, and vehicles and provides immediate audio feedback.

- ✅ **Essential Location Recognition**  
  Identifies public facilities such as bus stops, buildings, and other landmarks.

- ✅ **Voice Command Interaction**  
  Allows users to search for locations and routes using simple voice input, eliminating the need for visual interaction.
